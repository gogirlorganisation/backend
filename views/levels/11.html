<h1>Loops: For</h1>
<p>
	What’s the laziest thing, creature, or entity to have ever existed?<br>
	Is it a sloth? A slug, maybe?<br>
	No...it’s a programmer!<br><br>

	Is there really anything worse than writing the same code again and again and again and again?<br>
	A customer places an order for a 100 cupcakes. Eve needs to make a receipt for the purchase. So, she wants print ("Cupcake $2.40"), 100 times, she’s not going to repeat this code a 100 times. Instead, she’ll use a new feature- <b> loop.</b><br>

	 <pre>
#There is indentation space in for loops too!
For variable in range(0,numberoftimes):
  code
		</pre>

	<pre>
for x in range(0,100):
  print("Cupcake $2.40")
	</pre>


	Here, the variable x will go (i.e. iterate) from 0-99, printing <b>Cupcake $2.40</b> each time it completes one iteration.<br><br>

	Note: Like slicing, the first value is inclusive whereas the second value is exclusive thus the value of x changes from 0 - 99 and not from 1 - 100.<br><br>

	Eve needs to count the number of eggs, thus she needs the computer to print numbers from 0 to 15.You can print numbers between 2 numbers by just adjusting the range. In this case it would be<br><br>

	<pre>
for x in range(0,16):
  print(x)
	</pre>

	<b>Note:</b> Keep in mind that the the values of x will vary from the first number till the (last number - 1)<br><br>

	Let’s apply the if-else statements we learned earlier to loops.<br>
	Suppose we want to check which numbers between 1-10, are even  and which are odd. Then it will be done in the following way:<br><br>

	<pre>
for x in range(1,10):
  if(x%2 ==0):
    print ("even")
  else:
    print("odd")
	</pre>


</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>
	Eve loves numbers with factors! She wants to create a function that determines the <a id="w1" href="#" onclick="return false;"><b>factors</b></a><span id="p1" class="hidden">(A factor of a number divides the number <a id="w2" href="#" onclick="return false;"><b>completely!</b></a><span id="p2" class="hidden"> Use '%' to check the divisibility</span>)</span> of the number entered. Can you help her?
	Print the sum of all the factors of 42.
