<h1>And, Or, Not</h1>
<p>
	The keywords ‘and’, and ‘or’ are used to join together boolean expressions. The syntax is:<br><br>

	if condition1 and/or condition2:<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Statements
	<br><br>
	The keyword ‘not’ just changes a True condition to False and vica versa.

</p>

<h3>Or</h3>
<p>

A customer wants cakes worth either $7 or $20.<br><br>

<pre>
if price == 7 or price== 20:
  print("Buy this cake!")
else:
  print("Don't buy this cake!")
</pre>

Or statements returns True if even one condition is True. So, if the price is equal to 7 the condition (price == 7 or price== 20) will return True and "Buy this cake!" will be printed.

</p>

<h3>And</h3>
<p>

The customer realized this condition isn't very logical. Instead of selecting cakes at two drastically different price points, he now makes a range of values. If the cake is more than $7 and less than $20, he'll buy it. This way, he gets more options with the same amount of money!
<br><br>

<pre>
if price > 7 and price < 20:
  print("Buy this cake!")
else:
  print("Don't buy this cake!")
</pre>


And only returns True if both the statements are True. So, if the price is equal to 21 the condition (price == 7 or price== 20) will return False and "Don't buy this cake!" will be printed.

</p>

<h3>Not</h3>
<p>

Another customer walks in. This one want fancy cakes and won't buy anything below $25 <br>

<pre>
if not (price < 25):
  print("You can buy this cake!")
else:
  print("Don't buy this cake!")
</pre>

The not keyword is used to flip the boolean value. If the condition is false, the boolean is true, and vice versa.<br>
So, if the the price of the cake is less than 25 then the condition <pre>(price < 25)</pre> will return True but the condition <pre>not(price < 25) </pre> will return False thus the cutomer won't buy the cake and the else condition would run. <br> <br>

A follow-up question: How would you rewrite this without using the 'not' keyword, but with a > operator? Try it out right now!

<p>

	Eve needs to be at the bakery from 12:00 to 20:00, and she has asked you to write a program for her friends to check if she’s free or not.<br>So, if her friends input 8, the output would be<br><br>
	"Eve is free at 8" or "Eve is not free at 8"<br><br>
	Print the output for 1pm (or 13:00, input would be 13)<br><br>

	<a id="w1" href="#" onclick="return false;"><b>How to concatenate integers with strings?</b></a><span id="p1" class="hidden"> The input of the time is an integer, so to add it to a string we would need to first convert it to the string because you can't add a string and int together. 
	<pre>
date = int(input("Enter your birthdate! "))
print("Your lucky number is " + str(date))
	</pre>
	Make sure you enclose the integer in str() before adding it to a string.
