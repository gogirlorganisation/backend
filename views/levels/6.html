<h1>String Operations</h1>
<p>
	We’ve been talking a lot about working with numbers, so now, we’ll be talking about what are the things you can do with strings!<br>

	<h4>Concatenation</h4>
	<br>
	Earlier, we learnt about strings as collections of characters. Concatenation is a way of joining multiple strings together. You can easily add strings to build a complete sentence by using the addition operator - i.e. the ‘+’ sign. Crazy, right?

	<pre>
word1 = "ginger"
word2 = "bread"
word3 = word1 + word2
	</pre>

	Now, word3 will read gingerbread. Thus, we have concatenated word1 and word2. <br> <br>

	<b>Note:</b> Do not use this in your examination! We don’t want your English teacher to faint!

</p>

<h4>Uppercase and Lowercase</h4>
<br>
<p>

	There is a handy feature in Python that helps convert the characters in a string to uppercase or lowercase. Let’s look at an example to show you how it works.

	<pre>
word1 = "GiNgEr"
word1 = word1.upper()
print(word1)
print("BrEaD".lower())
	</pre>

	The output looks like this:<br>
	GINGER<br>
	bread<br>
	<br>

	You can see how adding .upper() or .lower() to a variable or to a string can change its case.

</p>

<h4> Length of Variables</h4>
<p>

What do you do if you want to know the length of a string? We know that the word ‘Hello’ contains 5 letters. <br> <br>

Instead of counting each letter, we can let the computer do it for you. All you need to do is use a function called len(). <br>

<pre>
len("Eve likes to go shopping")
</pre>

Output: 24 <br> <br>

<b>Note:</b> len() function counts spaces too!<br> <br>

Did you notice something strange? 24 is not printed on the screen. That’s because you haven’t called the print function to do it for you! Go ahead and do it! <br> <br>

You can use it with variables too! <br> <br>

<pre>
greetings = "Hello"
Length_of_greeting = len(greetings)
print(Length_of_greeting)
</pre>


Output: 5

</p>

<h4> Indexing </h4>

<p>

Eve wants to print the letter at the second index position in "HELLO". <br>
Can you help her do that? For accessing specific letters in a string we have to write the following: <br>

<pre>
String[postion_of_the_letter]
</pre>

For example:<br>

<pre>
word = "HELLO"
print(word[2]) # or just "HELLO"[2]
</pre>

The output is… <br>
L <br> <br>

That shocked you, didn’t it? Although L is the third letter in the word HELLO, it is in the <b>second index</b> position.<br> <br>

Programmers are weird like that. They like to count from 0. Look at the image attached to get a better sense. Now think about which letter you would get if you printed the fourth index position.<br> <br>

<img src="/img/illustrations/hello01234.png" alt="Bakery" width="100%">

The answer is…<br>
O<br>
Yes! You did it! O is the fifth letter but has the fourth index position assigned to it.
</p>

<h4> Slicing </h4>

<p>
<pre>
amazing_programmer = "Ada Lovelace" 
</pre>

Phew...that’s a <b> long </b> name! Eve wants to just print out the first name. How would she do that? <br> <br>
To get a part of a string we need to write:<br>
<pre>
Variable_name[starting_index : ending_index]
</pre>

A is at index position 0 and the 2nd A is at index position 2. To print out "Ada", we need to write<br>

<pre>
print(amazing_programmer[0:3])
</pre>

You might be wondering why we used 0:3 instead of 0:2. That’s because the first index number is <a id="w1" href="#" onclick="return false;"><b>inclusive</b></a><span id="p1" class="hidden"> (includes that position)</span> and the last index number is <a id="w2" href="#" onclick="return false;"><b>exclusive</b></a><span id="p2" class="hidden"> (doesn’t include that position)</span>. In other words, the sliced string only includes characters up to the character before the ending index.<br> <br>

Now, Eve wants to print out "Love". Can you try to do that for her?<br> <br>
Done? Here’s the answer:<br>

<pre>
print(amazing_programmer[4:8])
</pre>

Wondering why it isn’t 3:8? That’s because we count a space " " as one position too! So, L comes at the 4th index position.<br> <br>

Got it? Good!
</p>
<br><br>


<h2>Question</h2>

<p>

	Eve wants to improve her previous greeting program! This time she wants to greet the user in a better way. Ask the user for their name and use your newly acquired string manipulation skills to greet them in the following way:<br><br>

	"Welcome to the bakery Eve! What would you like to order today?"<br><br>

	Hint: Use string concatenation!
