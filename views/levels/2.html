<h1>Syntax and Printing</h1>
<p>
	While writing a program we’ll be using two tools:<br>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Text Editor:</b> The place where you tell a program what to do.</li>
		<li><b>Console:</b> The place where the computer returns information after processing what you asked it to do.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	You’ll be spending a huge portion of your time writing your programs and code using a text editor, before running the code via a console.
</p>

<p>
	As a budding programmer like yourself, you’ll have to write lots and lots of code. How you write the code is very important - you need to follow some rules when you write this code. Otherwise, the computer can’t understand what you’re writing at all, and your code won’t run! This is what we call  <a id="w1" href="#" onclick="return false;"><b>‘Syntax’</b></a><span id="p1" class="hidden"> (You will come across many <i>fancy</i> words which mean simple things. Try and remember as many technical terms as you can!) </span> . It is the arrangement of words to create sentences in a language. Just like we how we need to follow proper grammar rules in any language (like Hindi and English), we do the same in Python. We will cover the rules of writing any code in Python as we go along talking about what you can do using this programming language.

<p>

<p>
	So, let’s get started with talking to a computer in Python!<br><br>

	We’ll start off with the tool in programming that you’ll use the most; printing. It basically returns whatever you give it.<br><br>

	Let’s take the following as an example:<br>
</p>

<pre>
print("Hi, My Name is Eve!")
</pre>



<p>
	There are two important parts to this: <br>
<ol>
	<li><b>"Hi, My Name is Eve!"</b>: This is called a string. For now think of it as a chain of letters, numbers or anything you can type on your keyboard.</li>

	<br> <br>
	<li><b>print()</b>: Anything you put in between the brackets is returned by the computer into the console.</li>

</ol>

	<br>

	Let’s test this out! Print out your name and press the compile button.

</p>

<p>
	During the course of this tutorial, you will come across many statements starting with a hashtag(#). These are known as comments and are used to explain to code to people who read it - these are not run by the computer.
</p>

<pre>
print("Hello")
#Hello is printed on the screen
#These comments are not
</pre>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>
Eve wants the computer to know the address to her family bakery (155 Main St, Delhi 84101, INDIA). Print the address to let the computer know!
