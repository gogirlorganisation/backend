<h1>Loops: While</h1>
	<p>
		Eve has had a hard day at work at the bakery today.So, she wants to take a nap. She’s told her mum not to disturb her  <b> while </b> she’s sleeping. Once  she wakes up, her mother can give her chores. Her request condition expires or, is terminated, once she wakes up and is no longer sleeping.<br><br>

		While eve is sleeping:<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t disturb her

		<br><br>
		This is the basic principle of a <b> While Loop </b>. The while loop tells the computer to do something as long as <b>the condition</b> is met. <br><br>

		The condition is evaluated, and if the condition is <b>true</b>, the code within the block is executed. This repeats until the condition becomes false.<br><br>

		The syntax for while loop is :

		<pre>
while a condition is True:
  code
			</pre>
		<br>
		Eve can’t sleep, so she decides to count sheeps till 25. Let’s try printing values from 1 till 25 using a while loop.<br>
		<img src="/img/illustrations/sheep.png" style="
			-webkit-filter: drop-shadow(0 0 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.2));
			filter: drop-shadow(0 0 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.2));
			margin-top: 2rem;
			display: block;
			margin-bottom: 2rem;
			width: 35%;
			float: right;
		">
		<pre>
sheep_counter = 1
while sheep_counter < 26:
  print(sheep_counter)
		</pre>

		Oh no! What happened, the computer is just printing 1 and is not even stopping!<br>
		Don’t worry, you are just stuck in an <a id="w1" href="#" onclick="return false;"><b>infinite loop</b></a><span id="p1" class="hidden"> (Infinite loop is nothing but when there is no end condition to the loop thus the code runs forever. No programmer want this to happen!)</span> as the condition sheep_counter (which has a value of 1) is less than 26 is always True! Let’s update the value of the sheep_counter after each <a id="w2" href="#" onclick="return false;"><b>iteration.</b></a><span id="p2" class="hidden"> (one cycle of running the code)</span><br><br>

		<pre>
sheep_counter = 1
while sheep_counter < 26:
  print(sheep_counter)
  sheep_counter = sheep_counter + 1
		</pre>

	<h2>Question</h2>

	<p>

		Eve is given a long list of items that her family plans to put on the bakery menu. But due to limited space she <b>can’t</b> fit items with the length longer than 12 characters. Help her out by printing all the list items that won’t fit.
		<ul>
			<li>Butter</li>
			<li>Milk</li>
			<li>Dark Chocolate</li>
			<li>Bread</li>
			<li>Vanilla Cupcakes</li>
		</ul>
